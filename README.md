# Bank-Customer-Card-Prediction-App
In this project we are going to predict the bank customer card prediction using machine learning.

# Introduction
We have a dataset that contains information about people that are using cards issued by a particular bank. It states out some of 
the characteristics of these people which includes family information, marital states and how often and in what way are they using 
the bank issued cards. 

We will be using this dataset to predict the type of card a customer may issue.
